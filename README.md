## 🌟 Features
### Layered Memory System
This architecture consists of three layers:

1. **Short-Term Memory**: This is the first layer, designed for immediate information storage and access.
2. **Working Memory**: The second layer allows for task-related information processing. Use this for temporary tasks.
3. **Long-Term Memory**: The final layer stores information for future use. Here, you can save important knowledge from your interactions.

### Custom Skills Creation
With the Claude Layered Memory Architecture, you can create customized skills that suit your learning needs. These skills enhance your interactions with the AI, providing a more tailored experience.

### User-Friendly Interface
We designed the interface to be as intuitive as possible. Anyone can navigate through the menus without any prior experience in AI or programming.
